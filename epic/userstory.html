	<br>
	<br>
	<li> Last year William realized that the deadline to apply for his hunts were at 5 pm, while driving back from his most recent
		fishing trip. He tried to call his daughter and customer service but had no service. By the time he got home, it was now
		after 4 pm. He missed out on hunting in 2019 because the wait with customer service was over an hour</li>
	<li>He plan's to become a user on this site, so that he can put in for his hunts at his convenience and not worry
		about waiting for help and still enjoy his long fishing trips</li>
